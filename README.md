# DinnerFor11

DinnerFor11 proves that OP(3,3,5) has no solution. Despite the result is well known in literature, there is no proof other than a *self-referencing unpublished paper*.
We quote the original source paper cited by most of the literature:

*Of course, the ‘problem’ is to decide whether the above conjecture is true or false. (The first ‘exceptional case’, namely C(4,5)!=K(9), has been proven by several authors; in an unpublished paper [6] the author proved C(3,3,5)!=K(11) with the aid of a computer.)*
